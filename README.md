# Golang Snippets

This repository is a collection of applications written in Golang. You will find a range of well documented and well written code examples from the simplest hello world to more complex applications.

Most of the programs here can be found in "The Go Programming Language" book by Brian Kernighan, but the idea is to expand beyond that.

Feel free to contribute with your own ideas, just make sure to include a few lines before your main function explaining what the code does.
